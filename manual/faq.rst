Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Where can I find the Pontoon's logs?
------------------------------------

You can find the Pontoon's logs in the system logs. By defaut they are in the ``/var/log/syslog`` file.

Pontoon logs are logged as ``gunicorn`` in the logs so you can display them in real time with the following command::

    tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep gunicorn


How to access the Django Admin?
-------------------------------

You can access the Django Admin on the ``/a/`` route of your Pontoon installation. Example::

    https://pontoon.example.com/a/

If you are not able to access this page, it means you have insufficient permission. See bellow to promote your user as superuser.
